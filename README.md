## Incognito Count

This is a chrome extension for displaying the amount of incognito windows which are currently open.

###Why?

When testing cookie centric webpages, it's easy to have more than one incognito window open, Google's Incognito windows share the same cookie storage which can lead to false results.

This plugin displays a count of windows open and allows you to close all incognito windows open at one time with a couple of clicks.

There is also an added bonus that by using the shortcut **Control + Alt + N** it will jump to the first non-incognito window.

### Prerequisites

To enable the count of incognito windows, **this extension needs to be enabled in incognito mode**. 

Open chrome://extensions, you then need to check the box which allows the extension to work in incognito mode.

There are no special permissions required for this plugin.
